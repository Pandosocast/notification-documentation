# Integrate with the API

This documentation is for developers who want to integrate the GC Notify API with a web application or back office system.

Integrating the GC Notify API allows you to send email or text messages automatically. You might do this if you have a system that tracks a business process so that whenever there is a status change, your clients receive a notification about the update.
