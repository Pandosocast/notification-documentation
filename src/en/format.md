# Formatting emails

Use this guide to write email message teemplates. Make sure to send yourself a test message before sending to recipients to ensure the formatting looks good.

## Titles

To add a title to your message, use the number sign ( # ) followed by a space. To add a subtitle, use two number signs ( ## ) followed by a space. Try to make your title an answer rather than a question.

## Bold and italic

To add bold, use two asterisks ( ** ) on each side of your text. To add italic, use underscores ( _ ) on each side of your text. 

## Sections

To separate the message into sections, use three underscores ( ___ ) to create a horizontal line. This can help recipients take in information at a glance.

## Bulleted lists

To add bullet points, use asterisks ( * ) followed by a space. Bullet points help recipients identify important information quickly.

## Emphasis

To emphasize part of your message like a block quote, use a caret ( ^ ) followed by a space in front of the text to add a vertical grey bar beside the text.

## Links 

To include a link, add the full URL (starting with https://) and it will become a clickable hyperlink.

To embed a link in your message, use square brackets around descriptive text, followed by round brackets around the URL. Make sure links make sense out of context (avoid "click here").

To include a personalised link in your message, use double round brackets around the personalised link as you would for a [variable](personalise.md). To embed a personalised link, use square brackets around the descriptive text, followed by triple round brackets around the variable link.
